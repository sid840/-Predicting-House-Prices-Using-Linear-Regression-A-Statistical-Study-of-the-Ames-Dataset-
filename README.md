This study focuses on predicting housing prices using the Ames Housing dataset. By applying statistical analysis and linear regression models, it identifies key factors such as property size, location, and quality that influence sale prices. The dataset includes 2880 observations and 78 features, and the models are evaluated using metrics like RMSE. Visualizations such as scatter plots and boxplots help to interpret the relationships between variables, providing insights into the factors driving property values.
